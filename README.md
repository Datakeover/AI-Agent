The Task Automator AI Agent is a lightweight, extensible agent designed to handle repetitive digital workflows so you can focus on high-value work.

🚀 What it does

Automates routine tasks (data entry, scheduling, content drafting, file management, etc.)

Connects to APIs and services to streamline workflows

Learns from prompts and adapts to new use cases

Most automation tools are rigid or locked into specific platforms. This project explores a flexible, AI-first approach — an agent that can take instructions in natural language and turn them into actions.

🛠️ Tech stack

Python 3.11+

Modular agent architecture (src/ai_agent/)

GitHub Actions CI for testing

Future support for plugins + integrations

🌱 Project goals

Build a robust agent framework anyone can extend

Showcase how to safely use AI for workflow automation

Open-source a base people can customize for their business or personal needs
